These scripts let you create take markers called "SYNC" on all selected items at the edit cursor position using the script "soba_CreateSyncMarker.lua".
The script "soba_SyncMarkerToCursor.lua" moves the selected items containing sync markers so that the sync markers align with the edit cursor.
This functionality is inspired from Pro Tools' Sync Points.
